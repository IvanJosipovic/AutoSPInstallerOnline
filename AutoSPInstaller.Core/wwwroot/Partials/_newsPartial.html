        <h2 class="panel-title">Announcing support for SharePoint Server 2019 Preview!</h2>
        on Wed July 25 2018
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        We’re pleased to announce that, right behind the heels of the recent announcement of the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Announcing-Availability-of-SharePoint-Server-2019-Preview/ba-p/214427">Public Preview of SharePoint Server 2019</a>, AutoSPInstaller.com now has the ability to help you build an AutoSPInstaller XML configuration to build out a SharePoint 2019 farm.
        <br />
        Make sure you download the most recent version of <a href="https://github.com/brianlala/autospinstaller">AutoSPInstaller</a>, then use this site to built out (or validate) your XML configuration.
        <br />
        To be honest, not a whole lot has changed at this point, but at least you’ll be able to target the 2019 version and use some of the new site templates available with the most recent on-premises offering.
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Docker Support</h4>
        We've recived many compaines that AutoSPInstaller Online can't be without internet access or in secure environments due to it being online.
        <br />
        We have packaged up this site into a Docker container that can be used offline at any time. The docker images has Diqus (chat) and telemtry disabled. The source code is availble at <a href="https://github.com/IvanJosipovic/AutoSPInstallerOnline">https://github.com/IvanJosipovic/AutoSPInstallerOnline</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        To utilize the image, simply run the following command then navigate to <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>
        <br />
        <b>docker run -p 80:80 index.docker.io/autospinstaller/autospinstalleronline</b>
        <br />

        <h2 class="panel-title">Annoucing SharePoint 2016 support!</h2>
        on Thu Aug 26 2015
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>As soon as the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48712" target="_blank">Public IT Preview of SharePoint 2016</a> was announced, people started asking: "Hey when are you gonna update AutoSPInstaller...?" Well luckily, being a Microsoft employee now, I finally have access to some internal non-public releases. I had in fact already been working on updating AutoSPInstaller to support the new on-prem 2016 version. By the time the public preview was announced and made available. I'm happy to announce that, with most of the major compatibility issues ironed out, AutoSPInstaller now works with SharePoint 2016!</p>

        <p>Also as an added bonus, AutoSPInstaller also supports installing SharePoint 2016 on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview" target="_blank">Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 3...!</a></p>

        Having said that, there are some gotchas to be aware of. First, <a href="https://autospinstaller.com" target="_blank">autospinstaller.com</a> has a BETA imlementation for 2016, more validation is required. Second, as with any pre-release software, there are some gotchas and glitches, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>The installation of SharePoint 2016 itself (with or without AutoSPInstaller) sometimes errors out; most often, re-running the installation will work through this</li>
            <li>As was the case with previous versions of SharePoint and AutoSPInstaller, sometimes you may see a 'concurrency error' when provisioning certain services or service apps</li>
            <li>The new <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/mt346114%28v=office.16%29.aspx" target="_blank">SP2016 MinRoles</a> functionality has only been implemented in a basic way so far in AutoSPInstaller; for now you will need to be aware of what services are 'allowed' with each MinRole so as to not accidentally try to provision a service that's not permitted for a certain MinRole (e.g. Search on a DistributedCache server). We hope to implement the 'smarts' behind these service dependencies and relationships within the <a href="https://autospinstller.com" target="_blank">autospinstaller.com</a> UI soon though.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, service app creation will hang; you can tell this is happening if it's stuck for a long time on, for example, App Management service app provisioning and the Windows Task Manager shows next to no activity. The fix is to simply go into Central Admin, find the half-provisioned service app, delete it, then re-run AutoSPInstaller</li>
            <li>Windows Server 2016 TP3 wants to launch URLs with Edge. You may get red errors at the end of the script such as "This app can't be activated when UAC is disabled". These can be ignored as they just relate to the launching of the SharePoint CA/site URLs upon script completion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Finally, you can (and should) read more about the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/cc261970%28v=office.16%29.aspx" target="_blank">changes & known issues for SharePoint 2016</a>, and as always you can post a <a href="https://autospinstaller.codeplex.com/discussions" target="_blank">discussion item</a> or report an <a href="https://autospinstaller.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic" target="_blank">issue</a> on AutoSPInstaller on the <a href="https://autospinstaller.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Codeplex project site</a>. Also note that, as always, neither the AutoSPInstaller script/project nor <a href="https://autospinstller.com" target="_blank">autospinstaller.com</a> are supported by Microsoft.</p>

        <h2 class="panel-title">Update</h2>
        on Thu Jun 18 2015
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
        <p>
            Welcome to AutoSPInstaller Online, as you may know this site has been live for about a month.
            We haven't had any formal communication as to what is new or changing in the site.
            We decided to have a quiet launch so that we can fix any major bugs (there were a bunch, thanks to all that have reported them!) and to make sure the site performed as expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>New Features:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Automatic Schema upgrade from 3.98 > 3.99
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simply load your 3.98 XML file and it will be upgrade to 3.99.</li>
                        <li>We decided to update the Schema in order to make it more readable and easier to do side by side comparisons.</li>
                        <li>We plan to have this feature available for all future Schema updates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alert when leaving the site
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the Farm Configuration is only retained in the browsers memory, it will be lost if the user accidentally navigates away from the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Planned Features:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    XML Validation using XSD (XML Schema Definition)
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are many scenarios where the XML file is invalid to the point the site will not accept it.</li>
                        <li>One example is boolean values, in the XML world "True" is not a valid value, even though PowerShell accept it.</li>
                        <li>The XSD will return very detailed reason on why the XML fails. For example, ERROR: Element 'ClaimsToWindowsTokenService', attribute 'UpdateAccount': 'True' is not a valid value of the atomic type 'xs:boolean'.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server Rename
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow a Server to be renamed and retain all configuration which was mapped to that server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Predefined Templates
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow the ability to select predefined Farm Templates with recommended topologies, ie 3 Server and 4 Server Farms etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    More Validation
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are a lot more places where validation is required.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>As always, any feedback is appreciated, we are always looking for ideas on how to make things better.</p>

        <h2 class="panel-title">Introducing AutoSPInstaller Online</h2>
        on Thu Jun 18 2015
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>From Brian Lalancette, creator of AutoSPInstaller.</p>

        <p>Since I launched <a href="http://autospinstaller.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">AutoSPInstaller, the PowerShell-based process for installing Microsoft SharePoint Server</a> back in 2010, I've always felt it needed a little something "more". While I and many in the SharePoint community were pretty comfortable hand-editing the input XML file that contained all the farm parameters and settings, a lot of folks weren't necessarily keen on it. In addition, even someone experienced in editing the XML and building SharePoint farms could quite easily miss something or make a simple typo which could lead to pain & confusion at build time (trust me, I know). Not only that, but the process of hand-editing the XML had no rules built into it to help folks adhere to best practices, or even hard dependencies among SharePoint services and service apps. Sure, the script itself helped out with some of this, but it became a bit of a burden to try to capture all these rules within AutoSPInstaller itself plus handling them at run-time isn't optimal IMO.</p>

        <p>Then <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanJosipovic/" target="_blank">Ivan</a> created <a href="http://autospinstallergui.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">AutoSPInstallerGUI</a> - a user-friendly tool that allowed for much easier creation and editing of XML input files for AutoSPInstaller. While this tool was both promising and popular, I personally never got into it much for one reason or another. Maybe hand-editing the XML made me nostalgic for my brief days as a web dev, or maybe Ivan's UI at the time lacked the total control I wanted over the farm config - not sure. Regardless it was an overall well-received tool that certainly helped a lot of folks get their head around using AutoSPInstaller.</p>

        <p>Then came the 2014 SharePoint Conference in Las Vegas. There, I finally met Ivan in person, and we got to talking: What if, instead of a UI tool that users needed to download and keep current (bug fixes, new functionality etc.), we provided them with a slick web UI that captured and extended the functionality of AutoSPInstallerGUI, with lots more automation and validation? We felt this would be a huge win for both AutoSPInstaller and the SharePoint community in general. So slowly but surely we (well, mostly Ivan) went to work on it...</p>

        <p>A year or so later, we're proud to introduce <a href="https://autospinstaller.com/" target="_blank">AutoSPInstaller Online</a> - a slick, responsive web-based interface for creating, editing and validating AutoSPInstaller input XML files. AutoSPInstaller Online is the first such utility to have my full support and ongoing input, so I'm very excited about its potential and value.</p>

        <p>Give it a try - we're eager to hear your feedback and plan to continue to improve the site in the coming weeks and months.</p>

        Cheers,<br />
        Brian
